# SweetTemptations
This is a website I created during my first year of university, as part of the Web Development module. I am using mainly HTML and PHP for the coding part, as well as some JavaScript. I am also using CSS for the styles of my website. There is also database access, in MySQL, which I created as well during the first term of that year. 

The website's URL is: https://smcse.city.ac.uk/student/adbt208/register.html
